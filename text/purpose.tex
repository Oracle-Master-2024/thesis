The main goal of this project is to explore how free-list allocators can be integrated into garbage collectors. Specifically, we'll focus on adding a free-list allocator into the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) in the latest version of OpenJDK. Currently, ZGC uses sequential allocators to manage memory allocation in regions (explained further in Section~\ref{sec:background}). While this method is good at allocating objects, it struggles with external fragmentation due to bump pointers, as mentioned in existing literature~\cite{TODO:bump}. By introducing a free-list allocator, we aim to inform the garbage collector about available free space between allocations, improving memory usage within fragmented regions. Although this increases the workload for allocating objects, it could decrease the memory usage of programs using ZGC, which in turn could lead to better performance.

This project will evaluate the feasibility of integrating a free-list allocator into ZGC and evaluate its impact on throughput and memory usage. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to improving garbage collection techniques, potentially leading to more efficient memory management in the JVM.
