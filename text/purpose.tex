The goal of this project is to investigate to what extent a free-list-based allocator can be used to reduce intra-page fragmentation in a garbage collector. Most garbage collectors utilize bump-pointer allocation, enabling swift allocation and deallocation. However, the utilization of a bump-pointer allocator introduces certain drawbacks. One notable limitation is that a free-list-based allocator possesses the flexibility to allocate objects anywhere within a page, as opposed to being confined to the specific location indicated by the top-pointer in a bump-pointer approach. This inherent inflexibility in bump-pointer allocation may contribute to increased intra-page fragmentation, as objects are allocated strictly at the top of the available memory, potentially leaving unused space within the page.

We will explore what adaptions can be made to adapt an existing free-list-based allocator to be used in ZGC, a garbage collector in the OpenJDK, in addition to specific use-cases that could benefit from using the allocator as opposed to bump-pointer allocation.
