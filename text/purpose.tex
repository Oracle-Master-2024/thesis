The main goal of this project is to explore how free-list allocators can be integrated into compacting garbage collectors. Specifically, we'll focus on adding a free-list allocator into the Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) in the latest version of OpenJDK. Currently, ZGC uses sequential allocators to manage memory allocation in regions (explained further in Section~\ref{sec:background}). While this method is quick when allocating objects, it struggles with external fragmentation due to the nature of bump pointers, which is talked about in more detail in Seciton~\cite{background:memorymanagement}. By introducing a free-list allocator, we aim to inform the garbage collector about available free space between allocations, improving memory usage within fragmented regions. Although this increases the workload for allocating objects, it opens up the possibility of compacting memory in a new way.

This project will evaluate the feasibility of integrating a free-list allocator into ZGC and evaluate its impact on throughput and memory usage. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to improving garbage collection techniques, potentially leading to more efficient memory management in the JVM.
