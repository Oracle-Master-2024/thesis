This project evaluates the feasibility of integrating a free-list based allocator into ZGC and evaluate its impact on throughput and memory usage. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to improving garbage collection techniques, potentially leading to more efficient memory management in the JVM.

During this thesis, two different types of allocators are analysed with the purpose of gathering valuable knowledge about whether any one of the allocators has desirable characteristics for being used inside of ZGC. This offers great input into the future of the integration of a free-list based allocator, since it shows whether or not certain characteristics of allocators are beneficial for compacting memory efficiently.
