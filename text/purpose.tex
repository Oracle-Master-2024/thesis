The goal of this project is to investigate to what extend a free-list based allocator can be used to reduce intra-page fragmentation in a garbage collector. Most garbage collectors allocate using a bump-pointer, which allows for fast implicit deallocation. However, to implicitly deallocate a page, all objects on that page must be moved, which can be a costly operation, especially if the page is sparsely populated. Instead, we aim to fill the available space in a page using a free-list based allocator.
