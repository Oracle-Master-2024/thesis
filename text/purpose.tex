Evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of free-list based allocators in reducing memory fragmentation within ZGC. This is achieved by comparing the performance and memory utilization of a TLSF and Buddy allocator against ZGC's traditional bump-pointer allocation method. The comparative analysis focuses on key metrics such as allocation throughput, fragmentation, and overall performance efficiency.

Analyze the trade-offs involved in the integration of free-list allocators into ZGC. While free-list based methods potentially offer more efficient memory usage, they might introduce higher computational overheads or complexity in the allocation process. This study seeks to quantify these trade-offs, providing a balanced view of the benefits and potential drawbacks.

Explore practical implications and future applications of free-list based allocators in the context of ZGC and potentially other garbage collectors. Insights gained from the current study will inform recommendations for future research areas, particularly in optimizing the techniques used inside ZGC.
