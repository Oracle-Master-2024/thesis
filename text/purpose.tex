This project evaluates the feasibility of integrating a free-list based allocator into ZGC and evaluate its impact on throughput and memory usage. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to improving garbage collection techniques, potentially leading to more efficient memory management in the JVM.

During this thesis, two different types of allocators are evaluated based on how they well they are performing their operations. The goal of comparing the two different allocators is to study their behaviour in their integration into ZGC, and see if the two allocators have advantages or disadvantages at particular operations of the garbage collection cycle.
