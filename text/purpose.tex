The aim of this project is to assess the efficacy of utilizing a free-list-based allocator in mitigating intra-page fragmentation within a garbage collector. While many garbage collectors rely on bump-pointer allocation for its fast allocation and deallocation capabilities, it comes with limitations. Notably, bump-pointer allocation restricts allocation to a fixed location indicated by the top-pointer, whereas a free-list-based allocator offers greater flexibility by enabling object allocation anywhere within a page.

This inflexibility of bump-pointer allocations may cause an increased amount of memory fragmentation, as objects are allocated strictly at the top of available memory, potentially leaving unused space within the when previously allocated objects are freed. In contrast, a free-list-based allocator can distribute objects more efficiently throughout the entire available memory, thereby reducing fragmentation and maximizing memory utilization.

This thesis will focus on exploring, implementing and evaluating possible adaptations to an existing free-list-based allocator for use in ZGC, a garbage collector in the OpenJDK for the Java programming language. The aim is to replace bump pointer allocations with allocations made by a free list based allocator, leading to better memory utilization and reduced fragmentation.
