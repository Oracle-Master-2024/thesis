Partial compaction is in the context of memory management the act of compacting a small portion of the heap, with the purpose of decreasing the amount of fragmentation in the part of the heap that was compacted. It was proven by A. Bendersky and E. Petrank that it is indeed possible to reach lower levels of fragmentation with partial compaction and the use of a free-list based allocator~\cite{https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.its.uu.se/doi/pdf/10.1145/1925844.1926441}.
