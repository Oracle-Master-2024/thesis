This paper is related because it is about trying to decrease the amount of relocations being done in ZGC, however it does this by not performing relocations for larger objects. The results from that paper do not cover the trade-off between higher throughput and higher memory usage.

This paper is about compressing pointers in ZGC, which is another method of decreasing the total amount of memory needed by ZGC to operate.

TODO Explain these two papers in more detail, and how my report will try to achieve something similar.
