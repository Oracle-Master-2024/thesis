The main limitation of this project is that we will not be integrating the allocator into ZGC and OpenJDK. A scope of 20 weeks is deemed not enough to implement, adapt, evaluate and integrate an allocator and thus, the latest point will therefore be considered as future work.

Additionally, since ZGC is the garbage collector we will focus on adapting the allocator for only supports 64-bit architecture, we will limit ourselves to the same architecture when implementing it.
