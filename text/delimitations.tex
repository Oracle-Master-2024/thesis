The main limitation of this project is that we will not be integrating the allocator into ZGC and OpenJDK. A scope of 20 weeks is deemed not enough to implement, adapt, evaluate and also integrate an allocator.

Additionally, we will focus on adapting the allocator to be used for small and medium pages in ZGC exclusively. Large pages will not be considered in this work.

As this project will cover the integration of a free list allocator in a huge code base like the OpenJDK the project will be limited to using the free list allocator in the specific case of relocating objects in the garbage collector. Integrating it in more places would be a much bigger task and would not fit within the 20 week schedule for the project.

This project will not cover the implementation of the free list allocator, and will instead assume that an allocator exists with the required specifications.
