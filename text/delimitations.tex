The main limitation of this project is that this report will not cover the implementation of the allocator itself. This report only covers the integration of an already existing allocator. A scope of 20 weeks is deemed not enough to implement, adapt, integrate and finally evaluate the allocator.

As this project will cover the integration of a free list allocator in a huge code base like the OpenJDK the project will be limited to using the free list allocator in the specific case of relocating objects in ZGC. Relocation is a big part of ZGC, and is the method used for compacting memory. This is explained in more detail in Section~\ref{background:relocation}.

Additionally, this project will only cover the implementation of a new allocator in the specific case of relocating objects inside small units of memory. The different types are also explained in more detail in Section~\ref{background:zpages}, but the main idea is to only implement it where it is most needed, and small pages have more fragmented memory which makes it more useful then.
