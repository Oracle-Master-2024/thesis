The primary author and principal contributor to this thesis is Niclas Gärds. Niclas independently developed all sections, except Section~\ref{sec:background}, which was collaboratively authored with Casper Norrbin and Joel Sikström. Both Casper and Joel pursued their own theses in parallel with this one, focusing on adapting the buddy and two-level segregated fit allocators, respectively, for ZGC. The work done in this thesis is a natural extension of both Casper and Joel's research.

For the section developed in collaboration with Casper and Joel, the contributions are: Sections~\ref{sec:memory_management},~\ref{sec:fragmentation} and~\ref{sec:memory_allocation} are authored solely by Joel, Sections~\ref{sec:openjdk} and~\ref{sec:gc} are authored solely by Casper, and Section~\ref{sec:zgc} is authored solely by Niclas.
