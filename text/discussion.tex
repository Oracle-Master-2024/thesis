Something to consider is also how the relocation selection has previously selected how many pages to relocate objects from. ZGC in its current state has a set constant named "ZYoungCompactionLimit" which is used by ZGC during the relocation set selection phase. In section 7.2.1 I talk more about how the selection of pages works(todo). This technique for selecting pages to satisfy a compaction limit will not be accurate with the new implementation which includes the option to allocate objects into other pages. Additionally, it does not consider the age of the page as being of importance, because the current method only cares about the set of objects being relocated, and not the set of pages that are chosen for relocating into. An example of how this could be changed in the future is explained in Figure~\ref{fig:new_selection_of_pages TODO}. The figure shows us how the three steps taken by the previous methods can be chagned to take the age of the objects into account, making it possible to ensure that the free lists which are created actually have candidate objects that will potentially be relocated into them.
