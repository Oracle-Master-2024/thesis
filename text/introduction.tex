The goal of this thesis project is to investigate the possibility of using free-list allocators in garbage collectors. The project will focus on integrating a free-list allocator in the ZGC, a garbage collector available in the most recent release of the OpenJDK. Currently in ZGC, memory is allocated in regions using sequential allocators, discussed in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:background}. Although it is a very performance effective way of allocating objects, it is known that bumb pointers can cause a lot of external fragmentation in the memory. By making use of a free-list allocator, it is possible to let the garbage collector know that there is free space available in between allocations, allowing for allocations inside of the externally fragmented memory. This will add some extra work load on the allocation of objects, but will allow for using memory more efficiently. The project will investigate the feasibility of implementing this in future OpenJDK releases based on results shown by analyzing metrics such as fraction of fragmented memory, performance effects, and program liveness limits.
