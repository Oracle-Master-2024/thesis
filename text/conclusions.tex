\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
The work on the free list allocator has shown that it is possible to integrate a new allocator into the Z Garbage Collector. The results from this thesis has shown that there are indeed differences between using different allocators, and future work could look at which allocator is supposed to be used for certain tasks.

In this thesis, the most promising type of allocator that is to be used for compaction in ZGC is the TLSF allocator, which offered a greater throughput, and also was able reach lower amounts of fragmentation.
